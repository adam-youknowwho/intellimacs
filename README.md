# Intellimacs

These keybindings are heavily modified Intellimacs bindings that are fine-tuned to how Intellij IDEA works.

The main issue with Ideavim is that vim bindings don't work outside of the editor, so some of the actions
need to be bound to key bindings in IDEA itself.

For this reason I recommend the following bindings to be used for all the tool windows in IDEA:

- `<Alt> + 1`: Project Explorer
- `<Alt> + 2`: Move focus to editor
- `<Alt> + 3`: Toggle terminal
- `<Alt> + 4`: Toggle run window

Using these you can easily move focus around the main tool windows and refocus the editor when necessary.
